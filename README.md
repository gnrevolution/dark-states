Content Overview
The following Compendiums are available within the module, loaded with official content to help bring your Sprawlrunners games to life.
Please Note: Try to keep content inside compendiums when possible. Having hundreds or thousands of unneeded Actors, Items, or Journal Entries imported in your world can negatively affect Foundry performance.

Rules Compendium
The Dark States rules are organized into the same chapters as the printed book. If you know the title of the article you are looking for, use the search at the top of the Compendiums sidebar so you don't have to dig through multiple folders.
The rules have deep entity linking, which means that by clicking on the neon blue, underlined text in each article you will be shown more detailed information about the topic you chose. Some of these are subheadings inside a longer entry, so you may need to scroll down and read through the article to find what you're looking for.

Item Compendiums
The Item compendiums contain all of the Skills, Hindrances, Edges, and gear in Dark States, complete with fully entity-linked descriptions, ready to be dropped onto your actors. Note: Because of how Foundry is set up “under the hood”, some things are found in the Item Compendiums that are not traditionally thought of as items in Savage Worlds such as Edges, Hindrances, and Skills. Basically, under Foundry’s logic, if it can be dropped onto or manually added to your character sheet, it’s categorized as an item.

Powers, Edges, Hindrances, Skills & Equipment
Contains all of the Edges, Hindrances, Skills, and Gear in Dark States, complete with fully entity linked descriptions, ready to be dropped onto your actors.

Table Compendium
Contains a copy of the Action Cards which is required for macros (see below).

Macros Compendium
